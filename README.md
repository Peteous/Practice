  - I have no idea how much this program actually works. This was the last major java application I worked on (in high school) and I'm actually surprised I saved it at all. It's a GUI Java applet. I don't know if this was the final code or just part of it. A known bug was that the game ran differently depending on the processing power of the machine, due to the way we implemented time delays. I worked on this project with a collaborator. I am working with him to see if we cannot dig up the final code.
